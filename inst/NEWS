Changes to package FrF2 

The package is currently under intensive development. 
Most features have now been created, but there may still 
be some changes. Suggestions and bug reports are very welcome.

Version 0.96 31/07/2009
   - changed R version to R-2.8.0 or newer (extractor for class design does not work 
     with earlier versions)
   - added dependence to R version 2.7.1 or newer
   - a few clarifications in documentation
   - added legend element to element aliased in design.info for FrF2 designs
   - made seed occur on all design.info objects for function FrF2 
   - added nfactors to design.info objects for blocked designs
   - made repeat.only FALSE even if user made it TRUE for between block replications 
     only, where in fact there are no repeated measurements
   - bugfix:designs with 20 or more generators did not work in function FrF2

Version 0.95, 13/07/2009
   - included Bobby Mees very comprehensive new book into the references
   - included design 3-1.1 (cf. program in FrF2-devel) into catlg 
     in support of future implementation of inner/outer array designs
   - included possibility to select factors for which interactions are 
     to be plotted in IAPlot (was already available in MEPlot)
   - all experimental factors are now R factors in the data frame, 
     even if their levels are numerical values
   Bugfixes:
   - provided meaningful error message for internal function formula2matrix, 
     if user specified the formula for estimable in an inappropriate way
   - pb design with 8 runs and <=4 factors now effectively is the FrF2 design, 
     with all FrF2 properties, as was already documented before. 

Version 0.94-1, 06/07/2009
   Bugfix: Replicated blocks had the same block number or name in case of bbreps. 
     This is unreasonable and has been changed; with the changed version, the 
     blocking variable can be directly used in a (mixed) linear model analysis.

Version 0.94, 28/06/2009
   - added element creator to design.info attribute of designs created by 
     functions FrF2 and pb, and documented objects accordingly; this element 
     contains the call, but is called creator to allow it also to include 
     stored menu settings instead
   - added possibility to have negative generators (e.g. -ABD or -c(1,2,4))
     (before, levels had to be swapped) 
   - improved usage comfort and documentation for split plot designs in function 
     FrF2 (with WPfacs, specification of nfac.WP is no longer necessary; 
     the documentation of this aspect has been confusing and has been improved) 
   - started decoupling statistical and technical information in the documentation;
     purpose of this: shorter individual help texts and the possibility to re-use 
     the statistical texts for help from within R-commander in future package 
     RcmdrPlugin.DoE 
   - a few further improvements to the documentation have been made
   - modified function remodel to allow numeric variables with two levels 
     not equal to -1 and 1 
   - improvement of MEPlot: user can select effects to be displayed (option select) 
     (a similar possibility for IAPlot is not in place yet; so far, the model has 
     to be reduced in order to select effects for IAPlot)
   Bugfix: function DanielPlot gave error message in case 
     of non-significant effects only

Version 0.93, 24/05/2009
   - The constant Letters and some functions have been moved to new package DoE.base, 
     in preparation of the collaborating package group of FrF2, DoE.base, DoE.wrapper and 
     RcmdrPlugin.DoE.
   - documentation of factor.names in UtilitiesCat.Rd has been corrected 
     (not user-relevant, as affected function estimable.check is not to be called 
     directly by users)
   - removed unnecessary suggests for BHH2

Version 0.92-5, 18/05/2009
   Bugfixes 
   - simultaneous specification of nfactors and nlevels of length > 1 did not work 
     in internal function fac.design;
     this was not relevant for FrF2, but nevertheless wrong
   - estimable did not work with a formula using factor names rather than factor letters;
     this has been fixed, and an example with this feature has been added
   - catalogue catlg currently contains only one design each for large resolution V+ 
     situations (256 runs and more). The documentation of this aspect has been corrected.
   - deleted wrong statement in the documentation, that the complete catalogue of 
     128 run resolution IV designs with up to 24 factors is downloadable from the 
     authors website (it is simply too large and could not be uploaded)

Version 0.92-4, 15/05/2009
   Bugfixes and small changes regarding row numbering
   - third column of run.order for blocked designs was wrong
   - added original row number of design to columns 1 and 3 of run.order in case 
     of blocked and split-plot designs
   - row numbers of design itself and attribute desnum unified to always be the numbering 
     from 1 to number of rows (i.e. second column of 
     attribute run.order) regardless of design

Version 0.92-2, 07/05/2009
   Bug fixes
   - blockpick.big displayed wrong information about which effects 
     are aliased with blocks; corrected; 
     this bug only affected direct use of function blockpick.big
     and did not affect any automatic calculations within FrF2, 
     alias information in design.info attribute was always correct.
   - replication information attached to run order also for full factorial 
     designs and Plackett-Burman designs (functions fac.design (used by FrF2) 
     and pb)
   - corrected documentation of class design and functions pb and 
     FrF2 regarding the run.order attribute of class design output 
     (from 2-column matrix to 3-column data frame 
     with third column including replication information)

Version 0.92-1, 01/05/2009
   Bug fixes
   - hard to change factor number equal to nfactors gave indexing error;
     prevented by error message, since this does not make sense anyway
   - hard to change order was not the intended one --> changed

Version 0.92, 30/04/2009
   Substantial additions to function FrF2:
   - split-plot and blocking facilities
       including also functions splitpick, blockpick, blockpick.big
       and leftadjust that investigate the structure of 
       designs and may be useful for expert users
   - treatment of hard-to-change factors 
   Further changes to function FrF2 and its output:
   - made output object (class design) more informative
   - row numbers of design reflect replication structure
   - option select.catlg moved to an earlier position, 
     and made effective for more scenarios than before
   Additions to catalogues and catalogue utilities:
   - added print method for objects of class catlg in 
     support of inspecting available catalogue entries
   - extended standard catalogue catlg by some good larger designs
   Improvements to further utility functions:
   - added accessor functions for class design
   - added contrast contr.FrF2 for -1/+1 contrasts
     in line with 2-level fractional factorials
   - made character vectors in class design data frames 
     from package FrF2 into factors with contrasts contr.FrF2
   - made internal function alias3fi capable of handling more than 
     50 factors
   Bug fixes to documentation and error messages
   added examples and test cases (tests directory)

   far too many changes to be all mentioned in detail


Version 0.91-1, 15/04/2009
   Bug fix in documentation to function FrF2 

Version 0.91, 06/04/2009

   Additions to function FrF2: 
   - added functionality for "estimable", i.e. automated search  
     for designs that accommodate certain 2-factor interactions (2fis) well 
     (two approaches)
   - added possibility of replications and repeated measurements
   - added more design information to output of FrF2 and changed 
     output from list to data frame with attributes of new class design
   - FrF2 now also can do full factorials
   - renamed option max.nclear.2fis to MaxC2 (often used in the literature)
   Additions to function pb: 
   - added possibility of replications and repeated measurements
   Further changes:
   - modified function alias3fi (non-exported function) to allow allow 
     reducing detail to order=2
   - renamed catlg elements around clear 2fis to read "clear" and not "free",
     accessor functions analogously
   - grouped R-utility functions in files according to same pattern as 
     in Rd files
   - changed output of pb also to data frame with attributes of class design
   - extensions and clarifications for documentation
   - switched to FrF2, if pb is called for nruns=8 and nfactors<=4
   
   Bug fixes:
   - FrF2 code had gen instead of generators in two places
   - pb had a bug that prevented design generation 
     for those numbers of runs for which doubling is used 
     (40, 56,64,88,96)

Version 0.9-1, 24/03/2009

   A few minor bug fixes: 
   - Changed R version the package depends on to 2.7.0 
     (packages BsMD and scatterplot3d require this version),
     and added LazyLoad: yes and LazyData: yes to 
     DESCRIPTION file
   - tried to fix example error for Mac: 
     round instead of floor in check for nruns in FrF2,
     also changed check for nruns in pb
   - Bug fix on WLP.catlg, free.2fis.catlg and all.2fis.free.catlg: 
     now always return a named list, 
     even if the catlg object has only one element
   - minor clarifications in documentation

Version 0.9, 11/03/2009

   Added functionality for creating designs: FrF2 and pb create 
   regular and non-regular fractional factorials with 2-level 
   factors, together with a number of utility functions. 

Version 0.8, 16/02/2008

   added function for cube plots for showing means or fitted means 
   for three-way-interactions

   corrected bugs in documentation: plot functions MEPlot and 
   IAPlot do not take ... argument, and they were wrongly 
   referenced by their early development names "iap" and "mep" 
   in a few places 

   line width (lwd) choosable in MEPlot and IAPlot (affects plot 
   lines and axis thickness)

   title size of individual plots (cex.main) choosable in MEPlot

   legend in diagonal panels of interaction plot matrix (IAPlot) 
   improved

   alias numbers in interaction plots (in case of 
   show.alias=TRUE) sized by cex.lab

   right outer margin slightly increased for making outer border 
   visible in copied figures

Version 0.7, 16/12/2007 

   Bug-fix: functions DanielPlot and IAPlot did not work with aov 
   objects but only with pure lm-objects. This has been fixed by 
   letting the internal function remodel transform aov objects 
   into pure lm objects.

Version 0.6, 16/12/2007 

   Eliminated portability issue with example: Version 0.5 used 
   windows() for opening several graphics devices.

First version on CRAN: 
Version 0.5, 15/12/2007
