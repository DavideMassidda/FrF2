Changes to package FrF2 

The package is currently under intensive development. 
Most features have now been created, but there may still 
be some changes. Suggestions and bug reports are very welcome.

Version 0.92-2, 07/05/2009
   Bug fixes
   - blockpick.big displayed wrong information about which effects 
     are aliased with blocks; corrected; 
     this bug only affected direct use of function blockpick.big
     and did not affect any automatic calculations within FrF2, 
     alias information in design.info attribute was always correct.
   - replication information attached to run order also for full factorial 
     designs and Plackett-Burman designs (functions fac.design (used by FrF2) 
     and pb)
   - corrected documentation of class design and functions pb and 
     FrF2 regarding the run.order attribute of class design output 
     (from 2-column matrix to 3-column data frame 
     with third column including replication information)

Version 0.92-1, 01/05/2009
   Bug fixes
   - hard to change factor number equal to nfactors gave indexing error;
     prevented by error message, since this does not make sense anyway
   - hard to change order was not the intended one --> changed

Version 0.92, 30/04/2009
   Substantial additions to function FrF2:
   - split-plot and blocking facilities
       including also functions splitpick, blockpick, blockpick.big
       and leftadjust that investigate the structure of 
       designs and may be useful for expert users
   - treatment of hard-to-change factors 
   Further changes to function FrF2 and its output:
   - made output object (class design) more informative
   - row numbers of design reflect replication structure
   - option select.catlg moved to an earlier position, 
     and made effective for more scenarios than before
   Additions to catalogues and catalogue utilities:
   - added print method for objects of class catlg in 
     support of inspecting available catalogue entries
   - extended standard catalogue catlg by some good larger designs
   Improvements to further utility functions:
   - added accessor functions for class design
   - added contrast contr.FrF2 for -1/+1 contrasts
     in line with 2-level fractional factorials
   - made character vectors in class design data frames 
     from package FrF2 into factors with contrasts contr.FrF2
   - made internal function alias3fi capable of handling more than 
     50 factors
   Bug fixes to documentation and error messages
   added examples and test cases (tests directory)

   far too many changes to be all mentioned in detail


Version 0.91-1, 15/04/2009
   Bug fix in documentation to function FrF2 

Version 0.91, 06/04/2009

   Additions to function FrF2: 
   - added functionality for "estimable", i.e. automated search  
     for designs that accommodate certain 2-factor interactions (2fis) well 
     (two approaches)
   - added possibility of replications and repeated measurements
   - added more design information to output of FrF2 and changed 
     output from list to data frame with attributes of new class design
   - FrF2 now also can do full factorials
   - renamed option max.nclear.2fis to MaxC2 (often used in the literature)
   Additions to function pb: 
   - added possibility of replications and repeated measurements
   Further changes:
   - modified function alias3fi (non-exported function) to allow allow 
     reducing detail to order=2
   - renamed catlg elements around clear 2fis to read "clear" and not "free",
     accessor functions analogously
   - grouped R-utility functions in files according to same pattern as 
     in Rd files
   - changed output of pb also to data frame with attributes of class design
   - extensions and clarifications for documentation
   - switched to FrF2, if pb is called for nruns=8 and nfactors<=4
   
   Bug fixes:
   - FrF2 code had gen instead of generators in two places
   - pb had a bug that prevented design generation 
     for those numbers of runs for which doubling is used 
     (40, 56,64,88,96)

Version 0.9-1, 24/03/2009

   A few minor bug fixes: 
   - Changed R version the package depends on to 2.7.0 
     (packages BsMD and scatterplot3d require this version),
     and added LazyLoad: yes and LazyData: yes to 
     DESCRIPTION file
   - tried to fix example error for Mac: 
     round instead of floor in check for nruns in FrF2,
     also changed check for nruns in pb
   - Bug fix on WLP.catlg, free.2fis.catlg and all.2fis.free.catlg: 
     now always return a named list, 
     even if the catlg object has only one element
   - minor clarifications in documentation

Version 0.9, 11/03/2009

   Added functionality for creating designs: FrF2 and pb create 
   regular and non-regular fractional factorials with 2-level 
   factors, together with a number of utility functions. 

Version 0.8, 16/02/2008

   added function for cube plots for showing means or fitted means 
   for three-way-interactions

   corrected bugs in documentation: plot functions MEPlot and 
   IAPlot do not take ... argument, and they were wrongly 
   referenced by their early development names "iap" and "mep" 
   in a few places 

   line width (lwd) choosable in MEPlot and IAPlot (affects plot 
   lines and axis thickness)

   title size of individual plots (cex.main) choosable in MEPlot

   legend in diagonal panels of interaction plot matrix (IAPlot) 
   improved

   alias numbers in interaction plots (in case of 
   show.alias=TRUE) sized by cex.lab

   right outer margin slightly increased for making outer border 
   visible in copied figures

Version 0.7, 16/12/2007 

   Bug-fix: functions DanielPlot and IAPlot did not work with aov 
   objects but only with pure lm-objects. This has been fixed by 
   letting the internal function remodel transform aov objects 
   into pure lm objects.

Version 0.6, 16/12/2007 

   Eliminated portability issue with example: Version 0.5 used 
   windows() for opening several graphics devices.

First version on CRAN: 
Version 0.5, 15/12/2007
