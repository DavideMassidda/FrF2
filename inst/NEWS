Changes to package FrF2 

The package is currently under intensive development. It will 
see new features in the near future, but possibly also changes 
in current structure. 

Version 0.9-1, 24/03/2009

   A few minor bug fixes: 
   - Changed R version the package depends on to 2.7.0 
     (packages BsMD and scatterplot3d require this version),
     and added LazyLoad: yes and LazyData: yes to 
     DESCRIPTION file
   - tried to fix example error for Mac: 
     round instead of floor in check for nruns in FrF2,
     also changed check for nruns in pb
   - Bug fix on WLP.catlg, free.2fis.catlg and all.2fis.free.catlg: 
     now always return a named list, 
     even if the catlg object has only one element
   - minor clarifications in documentation

Version 0.9, 11/03/2009

   Added functionality for creating designs: FrF2 and pb create 
   regular and non-regular fractional factorials with 2-level 
   factors, together with a number of utility functions. 

Version 0.8, 16/02/2008

   added function for cube plots for showing means or fitted means 
   for three-way-interactions

   corrected bugs in documentation: plot functions MEPlot and 
   IAPlot do not take ... argument, and they were wrongly 
   referenced by their early development names "iap" and "mep" 
   in a few places 

   line width (lwd) choosable in MEPlot and IAPlot (affects plot 
   lines and axis thickness)

   title size of individual plots (cex.main) choosable in MEPlot

   legend in diagonal panels of interaction plot matrix (IAPlot) 
   improved

   alias numbers in interaction plots (in case of 
   show.alias=TRUE) sized by cex.lab

   right outer margin slightly increased for making outer border 
   visible in copied figures

Version 0.7, 16/12/2007 

   Bug-fix: functions DanielPlot and IAPlot did not work with aov 
   objects but only with pure lm-objects. This has been fixed by 
   letting the internal function remodel transform aov objects 
   into pure lm objects.

Version 0.6, 16/12/2007 

   Eliminated portability issue with example: Version 0.5 used 
   windows() for opening several graphics devices.

First version on CRAN: 
Version 0.5, 15/12/2007
