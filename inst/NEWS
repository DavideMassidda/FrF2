Changes to package FrF2 

The package is currently under intensive development. It will 
see new features in the near future, but possibly also changes 
in current structure. 

Version 0.91-1, 15/04/2009
   Bug fix in documentation to function FrF2 

Version 0.91, 06/04/2009

   Additions to function FrF2: 
   - added functionality for "estimable", i.e. automated search  
     for designs that accommodate certain 2-factor interactions (2fis) well 
     (two approaches)
   - added possibility of replications and repeated measurements
   - added more design information to output of FrF2 and changed 
     output from list to data frame with attributes of new class design
   - FrF2 now also can do full factorials
   - renamed option max.nclear.2fis to MaxC2 (often used in the literature)
   Additions to function pb: 
   - added possibility of replications and repeated measurements
   Further changes:
   - modified function alias3fi (non-exported function) to allow allow 
     reducing detail to order=2
   - renamed catlg elements around clear 2fis to read "clear" and not "free",
     accessor functions analogously
   - grouped R-utility functions in files according to same pattern as 
     in Rd files
   - changed output of pb also to data frame with attributes of class design
   - extensions and clarifications for documentation
   - switched to FrF2, if pb is called for nruns=8 and nfactors<=4
   
   Bug fixes:
   - FrF2 code had gen instead of generators in two places
   - pb had a bug that prevented design generation 
     for those numbers of runs for which doubling is used 
     (40, 56,64,88,96)

Version 0.9-1, 24/03/2009

   A few minor bug fixes: 
   - Changed R version the package depends on to 2.7.0 
     (packages BsMD and scatterplot3d require this version),
     and added LazyLoad: yes and LazyData: yes to 
     DESCRIPTION file
   - tried to fix example error for Mac: 
     round instead of floor in check for nruns in FrF2,
     also changed check for nruns in pb
   - Bug fix on WLP.catlg, free.2fis.catlg and all.2fis.free.catlg: 
     now always return a named list, 
     even if the catlg object has only one element
   - minor clarifications in documentation

Version 0.9, 11/03/2009

   Added functionality for creating designs: FrF2 and pb create 
   regular and non-regular fractional factorials with 2-level 
   factors, together with a number of utility functions. 

Version 0.8, 16/02/2008

   added function for cube plots for showing means or fitted means 
   for three-way-interactions

   corrected bugs in documentation: plot functions MEPlot and 
   IAPlot do not take ... argument, and they were wrongly 
   referenced by their early development names "iap" and "mep" 
   in a few places 

   line width (lwd) choosable in MEPlot and IAPlot (affects plot 
   lines and axis thickness)

   title size of individual plots (cex.main) choosable in MEPlot

   legend in diagonal panels of interaction plot matrix (IAPlot) 
   improved

   alias numbers in interaction plots (in case of 
   show.alias=TRUE) sized by cex.lab

   right outer margin slightly increased for making outer border 
   visible in copied figures

Version 0.7, 16/12/2007 

   Bug-fix: functions DanielPlot and IAPlot did not work with aov 
   objects but only with pure lm-objects. This has been fixed by 
   letting the internal function remodel transform aov objects 
   into pure lm objects.

Version 0.6, 16/12/2007 

   Eliminated portability issue with example: Version 0.5 used 
   windows() for opening several graphics devices.

First version on CRAN: 
Version 0.5, 15/12/2007
